# Ch2.Ento_Genome_Expansion
These codes are used in manuscript for TE-driven genome expansion in Entomophthoraceae, it's for analyzing genome composition

## First run EDTA on genome assembly to build TE library for each genome 
in pipeline folder run `01_EDTA.sh` script


## Run Repeatmasker with sensitive setting to do whole genome TE annotation
in pipeline folder run `02_RM.sh` script

## Draw repeatlandscape 
in pipeline folder run `03_repeatlandscape.sh` script
